Explain in your own words -- what happens with nested for loops?
 I
 f we have, for example, to for loops that count to 10:
 
 the first one runs through whatever is in it 10 times.
 
 The second one runs 10 times.
 
 The first one repeats that 9 more times, doing whatevr 100 times total.
 T
 his is essentially counting through a 2d grid since it counts through each y with each x.
