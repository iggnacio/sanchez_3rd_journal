In the Array Game assignment you have had to review and revisit concepts you may have forgotten about. 
These will all be tested on the final exam!
What is an array?

-A list of datatypes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How does one make a simple array of Strings?
String[]
///this is a 2d array
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the syntax for a 2-D array?

-datatype[]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the syntax for a 3-D array?

-datatype value[][]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How does one change the value for the third value in a one dimensional array? [Give specific code]

-list[2] = 0;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the syntax for a while loop?

-while(play == true){
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why use while loops in your game?
so you can end the game when you reach an objective or lose,without it the game would have no reason
for existing or playing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your game should be in a method outside of main --- How will you call your game in main?
input()

Why was it recommended that you use .toLowerCase() with your Scanner input?
(you could also use equalsIgnoreCase in the conditional statement) so it wouldn't matter what case 
the user's input was and you could just check for 1 or 2 things

-You should use different methods when moving the protagonist and to check for intersections. How? Why?

-Just have a method that returns a boolean(for just an intersects check) or an int(for different types 
of intersections/with different things).

-It would be cluttered to type it over and over again, and you would need to run/call it often
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What values will you pass across methods? how? why?

-My input method is passed the render method so it can run it at the end of the user input after adjusting 
player location or coordinates
