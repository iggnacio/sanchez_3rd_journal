package helloaldo;
#^^this is the name of the program^^

public class HelloAldo{
#^^public-because its shared with all other elements of the program^^
#^^class-they are like subsections of the program Ex.chapteers in a book^^
(programs are sets of instructions , e.g. classes,methods,and even variables)

	public static void main(string[] args){
#This is the main class ! This is important bcause ever java program has a main class
	system.out.println("hello world");
#This prints out the command in parenthesis wich is hello world in this instance^^
	}
}
# for every curly brace opening there must be a closed curly brace
#static class is that it is shared with everything
# void means it dosent pass anything down to others
#methods passes information downward
[you will have to memorize the public class line of code!]
