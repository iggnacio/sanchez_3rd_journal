What differences and similarites have you noticed? Provide at least 3 and explain in complete sentences.
c is older, i'm pretty sure, but it looks very similar to java

What code adaptations have you made? [Or will you make if none to date. Note: 'none' is not a valid answer]
In Circuit 3, we changed the speed of the program for fun.

What is required for a circuit?
power, path, resistor

How are programs compiled with Arduino?
the simple IDE we have

Describe the projects you have completed this/last week and what you have learned from them. Descriptions should be _at least_ one full paragraph in length.
Circuit 1- This one just set up a single LED, so it wasn't very hard and helped us begin to understand the different parts, i.e. resistors and wires.
Circuit 2- This introduced tge potentiometer, which was just a dial that changed how much energy the LED recieved. It used the same resistors, wires, etc
Circuit 3- This used the three-color LED. the wiring wasn't too hard, but the code did a lot of work and changed the color of the LED. 
Circuit 4- The code here 'introduced' us to for loops and arrays, which we already knew a lot about. The program had a pretty cool result but was kinda repetitive to set up.
Circuit 5- The buttons would be useful for the future project, but the circuit wasn't too hard. the code had input reading, I think.

You will be completing your own project - a project of your own design that accepts user input and provides light and sound in some way.
ok, ok....

Describe your project and the code adaptations you will have to make. [Note - 'none' is not a valid answer. For example, there is a 'Simon' game provided - using that code would earn a '0' because it is 0% your code.]
you told us nothing so I haven't thought of anything to do for a project yet.
