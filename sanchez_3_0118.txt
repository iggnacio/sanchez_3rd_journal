 The slick game i created is called The Maze.
The Maze is a single player game where you are 
placed in a man made maze with some company.
 There are skeletons set to kill any living thing in sight,
it will not stop till it kills you.
The objective of the game is to find the box of jewels in
the middle of the game without getting killed 

I solved a challenge in wich syntax errors came,and my map 
woukldnt run br=ecause the dimensions didnt match the 
64x64 game

I made my map and spritesheet during the breake but the dimensions
were wrong it was 32x32 instead of 64x64. i cry everytime

I concluded with the timeline, im just changing the dank images to
logical images.
