My game was pretty basic in the sense of that you had 2 answers Yes or No then it would take you somewhere else and only 1 answer was right and let you continue the game,the other answer would bring you back to the last step or kill you skillfully
at this rate my game is worth an 80 because the story is kind of lame so it will be an 80 solid.
