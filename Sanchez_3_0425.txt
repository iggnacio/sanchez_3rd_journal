 1.how to use classes/objects

  it's important for OOP and pretty much necessary for programming in most languages with out 
  being very inefficient
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.class constructors
  
  they are a necessary part of using object implementation (to tell the object/class which 
variables to be fed)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3.basic Comp Sci principles that we covered at the beginning of the year, like abstraction 
 and encapsulation
  
  Mr. Davis emphasized their importance because they are essential for learning and 
problem-solving etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4.maybe some basics of Slick

  we used it for a while and it was part of our learning of classes, objects, 
  problem-solving, etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 5.assembly/maybe HRM

    low-level languages are important for CS since they deal with basic computer manipulization 
  / software-to-hardware translation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 6. basic data types

  We learned them early on and they are necessary for using most languages
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 7.for loops and/or conditional statements

  They are another basic necessary part of OOP/coding
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 8.getters/setters and private variables
  
  without them a lot of variables you would want to use if you had similar-ish classes would 
  interfere if they were public
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 9.arrays vs ArrayLists

  arrays are an important part of most coding languages, and ArrayLists are useful in Java 
  or Slick or whatever used them
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.string manipulation and substrings/arrays 
  
  we practiced this on codingbat, these are useful any time you want to do something with a 
  String in java, like someone's name/character's name for interactivity
