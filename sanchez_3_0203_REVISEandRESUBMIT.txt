Why bother with revising and resubmitting?

We should revise our code  so we can use the code efficiently.
we dont want to add useless code to our programm, it will only
make it harder to understand it and will make it more reading 
that isnt necessary usefull. This would also make us make a 
differnt game out of a base game we can differentiate it from 
others.

We resubmit to show how we work
