Describe - what similarities do you notice between assembly and Human Resource Machine?

  Assembly also has jumps, like HRM, and doesnt have loops. They are low-level, 
and you instruct each part of the program.
They use lots of simple instructions like comparing numbers and basic math.

Describe - what differences do you notice between assembly and Human Resource Machine?

  HRM is easier to use since it explains everything, and you only use it to inbox / outbox 
instead of controlling the computer/machine.
